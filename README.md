# Module-16-Challenge
# What You're Creating
This new assignment consists of three technical analysis parts and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:
•	Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
•	Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
•	Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
•	Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:
•	Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
•	Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
•	Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
•	Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
